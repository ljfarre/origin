You have to run git init to start the git tracking and versioning process.
It creates the hidden git directory and the necessary files for git version
control to work properly.

The staging area is important.  It protects the working directory and the
repository.  When changes are staged, there is less chance of a mistake.  If a
mistake is made, only the staging area is affected.

You can use the staging area to control commits by comparing it to the
working directory.
